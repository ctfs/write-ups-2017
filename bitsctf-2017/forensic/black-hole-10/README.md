**Description:**

We are trying to study the Black Holes. One of the most controversial theory related to Black Holes is the "Information Loss Paradox". Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole. But this violates the quantum theory. To test the hypothesis, we sent our flag encoded in Base64 format towards a Black Hole. With the help of our Hubble Space Telescope, we got some pictures of the Black Hole. See if you can recover the flag from this information.
