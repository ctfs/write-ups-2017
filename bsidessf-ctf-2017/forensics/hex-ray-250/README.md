# BSides San Francisco CTF 2017 : hex-ray-250

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 250
**Solves:** 2
**Description:**

We found this USB stick at the blind drop. Our guys at the lab think the message has been encrypted. This hacker is good! Is there any way we can decode it?

Hint for hex-rays: 1) The png does not have what you are looking for. 2) No morse here, “..” is bigger than “:”
