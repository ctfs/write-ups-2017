# Ph0wn CTF: Toothbrushes are crazy

**Category**: Stegano, **Points**: 200, **Solves**: 0

## Description

You know what? I was working (hard, of course) at Fortinet, and then I passed by a phone booth. To my surprise, the phone booth was lit, but nobody inside, except a toothbrush.

And the toothbrush was behaving so strangely. Has it gone beserk?! I shot two videos of it:

    toothbrush1.mp4: sha256: 694b77acbe94e7dd2e0d6b018b283e07a5825adec193b4c57ba0d5f4f45ad68d
    toothbrush2.mp4: sha256: 234e9aea838c78f8e158893ee74a9fb4090316897dcc08e69a30fcb7ac1758c1

Important: you must find a flag in the first video and another one in the second video. Those two subflags do not follow the usual Ph0wn{...} format for this CTF. Rather you must build a string using this format : Ph0wn{part1_part2}. So, more precisely, you add Ph0wn at the beginning, insert the flag found in the first video, add an underscore, add the flag in the second video, put that in brackets, and submit that flag on our CTF server.

**HINT**: Do you hear the vibrations? They are important.
